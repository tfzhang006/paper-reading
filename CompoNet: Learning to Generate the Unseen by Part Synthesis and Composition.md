# CompoNet: Learning to Generate the Unseen by Part Synthesis and Composition

## Summary

## Research Objective
- How to enable a generative model to go beyond the observed observed samples and learn to generate "unseen".
## Background and Problems
- Existing generative models are always trapped or bounded by the empirical distribution of the observed data.
## Methods
- This
- Part synthesis unit.
	- 
- Parts composition unit
## Evaluation

## Conclusion
