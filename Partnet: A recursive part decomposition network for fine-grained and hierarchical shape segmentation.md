# Partnet: A recursive part decomposition network for fine-grained and hierarchical shape segmentation

## Summary
This paper proposes a model for hierarchical segmentation of 3D shapes, which is based on recursive binary decomposition.
## Research Objective
To segment a 3D shape in point cloud into an unfixed number of parts, depending on the shape complexity.
## Background and Problems
- Existing models are trained targeting a fixed set of labels.
- Labeling all primitives simultaneously cannot exploit the hierarchical nature.
