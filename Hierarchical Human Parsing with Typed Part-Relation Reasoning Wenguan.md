# Hierarchical Human Parsing with Typed Part-Relation Reasoning

## Summary
This work aims at modeling human structure using graph neural network(GNN) for better human parsing.
## Research Objective
Exploiting the representation capacity of deep neural networks to model human hierarchical structure and then perform human parsing.
## Background and Problems
- Human bodies present a highly structured hierarchy and body parts inherently interact with each other.
- Thus the central problem in human parsing is how to model such relations between parts.
- Efforts encoding pose information just weakly utilize the structural information.
