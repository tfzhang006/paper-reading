# PT2PC: Learning to Generate 3D Point Cloud Shapes from Part Tree Conditions

## Summary
This paper provides a solution for a novel conditional shape generation problem, which generates diverse 3D point clouds given the part tree condition.
## Research Objective
To generate a 3D point cloud geometry for a shape from a symbolic part tree representation.
## Background and Problems
- Extant work on holistic 3D shape generation does not explicitly consider part semantic and structural information in the generation process.
- In contrast, a structure-conditioned 3D generative model enables many real-world applications in computer vision and graphics.
