# Im2Struct: Recovering 3D Shape Structure from a Single RGB Image

## Summary
This paper develop a network to recursively decodes a hierarchy of cuboids from a encoded image.
## Research Objective
To recover 3D shape structures from single RGB images, where structure refers to shape parts represented by cuboids.
## Background and Problems
- Existing models which learn to reconstruct 3D volumes from 2D images lose shape topology or part structure information.
- Shape structure, encompassing part com- position and part relations, has been found highly important to semantic 3D shape understanding and editing.
- Different from shape geometry, part decomposition and relations do not manifest explicitly in 2D images. Mapping from pixels to part structure is highly ill-posed.
- Natural images always contain cluttered background and the imaged objects have large variations of appearance due to different textures and lighting conditions.
