# Learning 3D Part Assembly from a Single Image

## Summary
To solve a novel problem, single-image-guided 3D part assembly. 
## Research Objective
They introduce the task of single-image-guided 3D part assembly: inducing
6D poses of the parts in 3D space from a set of 3D parts and an image depicting the complete object. Robots
## Background and Problems
They aim to learn generalizable skills that allow robots to autonomously assemble unseen objects from parts.
