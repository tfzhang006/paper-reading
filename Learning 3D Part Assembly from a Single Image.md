# Learning 3D Part Assembly from a Single Image

## Summary
They introduce the task of single-image-guided 3D part assembly: inducing
6D poses of the parts in 3D space from a set of 3D parts and an image depicting the complete object.
## Research Objective
They aim to learn generalizable skills that allow robots to autonomously assemble unseen objects from parts.
## Background and Problems
- Robots can acquire geometry information for each part using 3D sensing, but the only information provided for the entire object shape is the instruction image.
