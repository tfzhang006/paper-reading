# Interpretable structure-evolving LSTM
## Summary
A bottom-up method is proposed to progressively obtain abstract representation in higher levels, which is based on evolving graph and LSTM network.
## Research Objective
Taking advantage of structure-evolving LSTM to perform human parsing.
## Background and Problems
- Existing LSTM models can only process data with pre-fixed structure.
- Semantic object parsing can benefit from modeling the contextual dependencies among regions in different levels.
