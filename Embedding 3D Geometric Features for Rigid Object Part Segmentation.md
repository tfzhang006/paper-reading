# Embedding 3D Geometric Features for Rigid Object Part Segmentation

## Summary
This paper proposes a 2-stream FCN to simultaneously extract 2D appearance features and 3D geometric features from image for object part segmentation.
## Research Objective
To utilize 3D information for better object part segmentation.
## Background and Problems
- The objects are 3D models rather than 2D figures in real world.
- 3D geometric features are also essential for object part segmentation.
- 3D information can be extracted from a 2D image.
