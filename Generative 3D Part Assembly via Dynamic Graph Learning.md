# Generative 3D Part Assembly via Dynamic Graph Learning

## Summary

## Research Objective
- To assemble 3D shapes conditioned on a given set of part geometry with variable number of parts. Moreover, the model knows little semantic knowledge on the input parts.
## Background and Problems
Without referring to any procedural or external guidance, e.g. reading the instruction manual, or watching a step-by-step video demonstration, the task of
