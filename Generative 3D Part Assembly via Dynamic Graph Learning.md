# Generative 3D Part Assembly via Dynamic Graph Learning

## Summary
This paper propose to 
## Research Objective
- To assemble 3D shapes conditioned on a given set of part geometry with variable number of parts. Moreover, the model knows little semantic knowledge on the input parts.
## Background and Problems
- Without referring to any procedural or external guidance, the task of 3D part assembly involves exploring an extremely large solution spaces and reasoning over the input part geometry for candidate assembly proposals. 
- Existing methods always assume certain part priors.
