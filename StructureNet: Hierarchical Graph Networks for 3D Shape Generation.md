# StructureNet: Hierarchical Graph Networks for 3D Shape Generation

## Summary

## Research Objective

## Background and Problems
- Because of the binary constraint, GRASS has to search over possible binarizations of the n-ary hierarchies found in objects, so that the binarized versions are consistent across objects in the same shape family.
## Methods

## Evaluation

## Conclusion
