# StructureNet: Hierarchical Graph Networks for 3D Shape Generation

## Summary

## Research Objective
To build a continuous latent space that can incorporate diverse shape variations, and subsequently to be exploited by various applications.
## Background and Problems
- Because of the binary constraint, GRASS has to search over possible binarizations of the n-ary hierarchies found in objects. The task of finding a canonical binary tree representation becomes increasingly challenging on a very large shape family.
## Methods
- A hierarchy of graph
	- Part representation
	- Hierarchical decomposition
	- Geometric relationship
- Hierarchical graph networks
	- Geometry encoder
	- Graph encoder
	- 
## Evaluation
