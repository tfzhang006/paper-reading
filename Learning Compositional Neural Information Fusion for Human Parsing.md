# Learning Compositional Neural Information Fusion for Human Parsing
## Summary
This work proposes to combine neural networks with the compositional hierarchy of human bodies for efficient and complete human parsing.
## Research Objective
To utilize cross-level information of body structure based on graph.
## Background and Problems
- Existing models fail to make full use of the rich structures in this task.
- Only focusing on leaf nodes in human hierarchy loses cross-level information.
## Methods
- Direct inference network
- Top-down inference network
- Bottom-up inference network
- Conditional fusion network
## Evaluation

## Conclusion
