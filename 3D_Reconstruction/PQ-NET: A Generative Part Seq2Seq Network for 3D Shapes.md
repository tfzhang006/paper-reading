# PQ-NET: A Generative Part Seq2Seq Network for 3D Shapes

## Summary
This paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder which encodes a sequence of part features into a la- tent vector of fixed size, and the decoder reconstructs the 3D shape, one part at a time, resulting in a sequential assembly.
## Research Objective
- A novel generative network using sequential part assembly.
## Background and Problems
- Most of existing works produce unstructured 3D shapes.
## Methods

## Evaluation

## Conclusion

## Notes
- Why does this method adopt a seq2seq model for shape generation?
	- They regard the assembly sequence as a “sentence” which organizes and describes the parts constituting a 3D shape. A sentence is both a linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases. Now that representing a shape in a hierarchical structure has be explored by many works, .
